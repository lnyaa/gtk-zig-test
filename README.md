gtk-zig-test
=============

test program to see how gtk3 and zig are viable together
 - answer: the first snippet of code from the tutorial works wonderfully
 - drawback: i'm writing zig but its basically c due to doing `export fn main`
    instead of doing something more closer to zig's stdlib w/ `std.os.args` or
    something. regardless, its there
